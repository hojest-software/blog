At `Hojest` we have a blog (blog.hojest.com) where everyone is invited to participate!
If you have anything to write about like a tutorial, tecnical tips, challanges, etc. feel free to do it!

##Steps
- Clone this repo.
- Checkout from `gh-pages` and create a folder named after the blog title (it must be unique).
- Create an `index.md` file inside the folder and start writing! You can use `Command + Shift + V` to preview it in VSC.
- Add your blog to `index.md` at the root of the repo.
- Add a title with a link to your blog's folder. For example [**Test Blog**](https://hojest-software.github.io/blog/test-blog/).
- Add a description.
- Add author, date and 1 or more tags about the blog subject. (< author_name > - < date > - < tags >).


Finally create a PR adding @Facu Lezcano or @Lucas Chizzoli as reviewers.
Even if the articles are under Hojest, fee free to add any reference to personal blogs or sites in the blogs!

If posible articles should be in english.
